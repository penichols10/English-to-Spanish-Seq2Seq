This is a basic model I made for English to Spanish machine translation to brush up on seq2seq skills. Halfway through making it, I realized the exact same problem is solved a similar way in Chollet's Deep Learning, so I haven't bothered to put much polish on the contained notebook.

Note the model has not been fully trained yet.
